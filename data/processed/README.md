# Processed Data

This folder is used to store **intermediate or fully preprocessed datasets** generated by the machine learning pipeline.

Examples of processed data include:

- Train–validation splits  
- Encoded datasets (label-encoded, target-encoded)  
- Feature-engineered datasets  
- Imputed datasets  
- Saved NumPy arrays (`X.npy`, `y.npy`)  
- Precomputed folds for cross-validation  
- Scaled / normalized versions of features  
- Any other artifacts generated during preprocessing

---

## Important Notes

### Processed data is **not** included in this repository
All files in this folder are **excluded via `.gitignore`** to:

- Keep the repo lightweight  
- Avoid versioning large generated files  
- Reduce clutter  
- Prevent accidental redistribution of derived data  

Only this `README.md` is tracked.

## How Files Are Generated (IF GENERATED AT ALL)

Processed files are created automatically when running the pipeline:

```bash
python src/train_models.py
